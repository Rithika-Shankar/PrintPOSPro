# PrintPOS Pro

**PrintPOS Pro** is an integrated printer and Point of Sale (POS) system tailored for the medical field to streamline prescription generation and billing. This application uses a voice-to-text transcription service for doctors to dictate prescriptions, a review and edit step, billing integration, and printing functionality. It also saves all records in a database for future reference.

Ensure that the POS printer is properly connected and configured. Follow your printerâ€™s user manual for setup. **PrintPOS Pro** supports various receipt printers via standard drivers.

---

## Deployment

### 1. Vultr Cloud Setup
- **Sign up for Vultr**: If you don't have an account, sign up at [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/).
- **Create a New Server**: Launch a new instance (preferably Ubuntu).
- **Deploy MySQL Database**:
  ```bash
  ssh root@your-vultr-ip
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install mysql-server
  sudo mysql_secure_installation
  ```
  
- **2. Create you Database**:
  ```bash
  CREATE DATABASE printposdb;
  ```

- **3. Transcription Service**:
Utilize Vultr's Object Storage or AI services to integrate speech-to-text features.

## Using Vultr Cloud Services

### 1. **Setting Up MySQL Database on Vultr**
   - **Sign up for Vultr**: If you don't already have a Vultr account, sign up at [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com).
   - **Create a New Cloud Instance**:
     - Select the cloud instance you prefer (e.g., a high-frequency or standard instance based on your usage).
     - Choose an OS (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).
     - Set up the SSH key and other configurations.
     - After the instance is created, you'll receive the IP address.
   - **Install MySQL**:
     - SSH into the instance:
       ```bash
       ssh root@your-vultr-ip
       ```
     - Update the server:
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt upgrade -y
       ```
     - Install MySQL:
       ```bash
       sudo apt install mysql-server
       sudo mysql_secure_installation
       ```
     - Log into MySQL:
       ```bash
       sudo mysql
       ```
     - Create your database for PrintPOS Pro:
       ```sql
       CREATE DATABASE printposdb;
       ```
     - Create a user for your application and grant the necessary permissions:
       ```sql
       CREATE USER 'printposuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON printposdb.* TO 'printposuser'@'localhost';
       FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
       ```

### 2. **Using Vultr Object Storage for Speech-to-Text Transcription**
PrintPOS Pro uses speech-to-text functionality for transcription of doctor-prescribed prescriptions. For this, you can use Vultr's **Object Storage** service, which allows you to store large audio files and then process them for transcription.

   - **Set up Object Storage on Vultr**:
     - Login to your Vultr account and navigate to the Object Storage section.
     - Create a new storage bucket for storing audio files (e.g., `prescription-audio`).
     - Obtain your Access Key and Secret Key from the Vultr dashboard.

   - **Integrate Transcription Service**:
     - Use the stored audio files in the bucket for transcription via an API like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, or any other transcription service that integrates with Vultr's Object Storage. You can upload the audio files from your frontend to the storage and then send them for transcription.
     - In your backend code, use the Vultr SDK to access the object storage and send the audio file for processing:

     ```java
     // Example using Java AWS SDK (compatible with Vultr Object Storage)
     AmazonS3 s3Client = AmazonS3Client.builder()
             .endpointOverride(URI.create("https://your-vultr-object-storage-endpoint"))
             .region(Region.US_EAST_1)
             .credentialsProvider(StaticCredentialsProvider.create(AwsBasicCredentials.create("access-key", "secret-key")))
             .build();
     
     // Upload an audio file
     File file = new File("path/to/audio/file.wav");
     s3Client.putObject(PutObjectRequest.builder()
             .bucket("prescription-audio")
             .key("audio-file-key")
             .build(), RequestBody.fromFile(file));
     ```

### 3. **Deploying the Application on Vultr**
   - **Set up a new cloud server instance** for both backend and frontend components.
   - SSH into the instance and deploy both the backend and frontend by following the previously mentioned setup instructions.
   - Use a tool like **NGINX** or **Apache** to reverse proxy your backend application for a public-facing URL:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nginx
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/printpos
     ```
     Inside the file, configure the proxy:

     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name your-domain.com;
         
         location / {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
         }
     }
     ```
   - After editing, enable the site and restart NGINX:
     ```bash
     sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/printpos /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

1. Ensure you have Laravel set up on your server.
2. Update your chatbot settings in `.env`:

```env
LARAVEL_CHATBOT_API_URL=http://your-laravel-backend/chatbot
```
3. Add the chatbot to your frontend:
   ```bash
   import Chatbot from 'laravel-chatbot-ui';
   ```
